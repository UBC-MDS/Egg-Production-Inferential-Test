#fixed the figure Rendering issue
During milestone 3 we ran into an issue while rendering where our tables were showing up but not the figure images. We later fixed this issue as our file paths were incorrect when running from the root of the repository rather than from the notebook. Moreover, we included `embed-resources: true` at the beginning of the file to embed all stuff together to make sure render successfully
