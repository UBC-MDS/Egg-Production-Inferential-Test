# Code Of Conduct

We aim to provide a safe and inclusive environment for both contributors
and maintainers. We expect all members to work collaboratively while
embracing diversity and being respectful of others. This Code of Conduct
outlines how we should behave in the online space of this project.

## Our standards

Examples of how to create a positive workspace for everyone includes:

-   Using professional and courteous language
-   Being respectful of others ideas and opinions
-   Giving constructive criticism where appropriate and being open to
    feedback

Examples of inappropriate behaviours include:

-   Using derogatory language
-   Posting personal information without authorization
-   Use of threats, harassment, excessive swearing or other behaviours
    that would be considered unprofessional within the workplace

## Consequences of inappropriate behaviours

If a contributor is found to be engaging in inappropriate behaviours, as
outlined in the previous section, they will receive a written warning
informing them of the breach of conduct. Project maintainers may remove
any comments/edits that do not align with the Code of Conduct. If the
member continues to violate the Code of Conduct, further consequences
include a temporary or permanent ban.

## Procedure for reporting a breach of conduct

Instances of inappropriate behaviour should be brought forward to the
project maintainers. All complaints will be reviewed and handled as
deemed appropriate, following the consequences of inappropriate
behaviours outlined above. Any complaints received will remain
confidential.
