###Code Of Conduct

We aim to provide a safe and inclusive environment for all group members. We expect all members to work collaboratively while remaining respectful of others.

##Our standards
Examples of how to create a positive workspace for everyone includes:
- Using professional and curteous language
- Being respectful of others ideas and opinions
- Giving constructive criticism where appropriate and being open to feedback

Examples of inappropriate behaviours include:
- Using derogatory language
- Posting personal information without authorization
- Use of threats, harassment, excessive swearing or other behaviours that would be considered unprofessional within the workplace

##Consequence of inappropriate behaviours
If a member is found to be engaging in inappropriate behaviours, as outlined in the previous section, they will recieve a written warning informing them of the breach of conduct. If the member continues to violate the code of conduct further additional steps will be taken as deemed appropriate by the other group members.

##Procedure for reporting a breach of conduct
Instances of inappropriate behaviour should be brought forward to the group as a whole, first as a written notice. Then further steps will be taken as required at the discretion of the group.
